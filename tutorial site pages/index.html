            <p>Welcome to our tutorial everyone!<p>
            
            <p>Today, we will teach you how to create a web page - using a basic implementation of 3-tier architecture in ASP.NET with C#. Before we begin, we will give you a brief background on three-tier architecture:</p>
            
            <p>Three tier architecture is a type of client-server structure where the user interface, functional process logic ("business rules"), and computer data storage (also data access), are maintained as independant parts. This architecture is also a software architecture and software design pattern. A more in-depth explanation of three-tier architecture can be found by visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture" title="An in-depth explanation of 3-tier architecture." target="_blank">this link</a>. Below is a diagram of the three-tier architecture, from Wikipedia:</p>
